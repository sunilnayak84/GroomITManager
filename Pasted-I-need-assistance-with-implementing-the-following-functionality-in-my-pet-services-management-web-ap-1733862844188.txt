I need assistance with implementing the following functionality in my pet services management web app:

Service Configuration:

Add functionality to categorize services as Service, Add-On, and Package.
A Package should allow grouping multiple services together at a discounted rate.
Appointments Integration:

The services (and their categories) should be available to select on the Appointments page.
Each appointment can have one or more consumables (e.g., Shampoo, Conditioner).
Consumables Selection and Inventory Deduction:

Add a feature for the groomer or manager to select the specific consumables used during an appointment (e.g., Shampoo Name: Hydra Whitening, Conditioner Name: Creme Silk).
Deduct the configured amount of consumables (e.g., in milliliters) from the Inventory page.
For example, if there are 1000 ml of Hydra Whitening Shampoo in inventory and 50 ml is used for the appointment, the updated inventory should reflect 950 ml remaining.
Appointment Completion Details:

At the end of the appointment, the groomer or manager should be able to capture:
Observations (text input).
Recommendations (text input).
Next Appointment Date (date picker).
User Interface Updates:

On the Services page, add options to categorize the service and configure consumables for each service.
On the Appointments page, allow selection of services from the database and enable adding/removing consumables dynamically.
Add fields for capturing Observations, Recommendations, and Next Appointment Date in the Appointment completion workflow.
Database Schema:
Please ensure the following schema fields are included:

Service Table:
service_id, name, category (Service/Add-On/Package), price, duration, description, consumables (list of consumables with item_id and quantity_used).
Appointment Table:
appointment_id, pet_id, service_id (link to Service table), consumables_used (list of selected consumables and their quantities), observations, recommendations, next_appointment_date.
Inventory Table:
item_id, item_name, quantity_available.
